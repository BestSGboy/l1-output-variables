## Pythpn
Pythhon is a object oriented-language

## output 
output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

## Date types

we will be working with 5 main date types
1. Integer (int) - mwhole number
2. character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. string (str) - collection of characters
  4. flotain point (float) - decimal numbers
  5. boolean (bool) -  true/false

##variables
variables are containers that hold a value

## rules for varible names
1 always start with a letter
'1name = "celin" ' -->' allowed
2 can only contsibn numbers, letters, and underscores (_) my name ="celinw"--> not LOWED
IF MORE THAN on word, use camelcase or underscores to separate words 'myfirstname' or 'my_first_name'
'myFirstName' or 'my_first_name'

## concatenation
'+' adding strings together, appending (add to end)

"hello" +"world" = "hello world"

## type cast
forcing a data type on a value

## to force a string into an integer
'int(variableName)'
